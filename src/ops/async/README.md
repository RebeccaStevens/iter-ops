## Async Operators

In this folder, we have operators that can only be added to an asynchronous pipeline.

Adding these to a synchronous pipeline will throw an iteration-time error, unless converted into asynchronous first (see [WiKi](https://github.com/vitaly-t/iter-ops/wiki/Asynchronous-Iterables)).
